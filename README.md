# Streetlight-Monitoring-and-Control-System

## Overview

This project aims to reduce electricity consumption by activating streetlights only when motion is detected and in low-light conditions. The system utilizes sensors to detect movement and ambient light levels, improving energy efficiency.

## Software Description

This system is controlled via an Android application developed using MIT App Inventor. The app sends control signals via Bluetooth to the Arduino board, which processes and executes the corresponding commands.

## Functionalities

- **'0'**: Turn off LED.
- **'1'**: Turn on LED.
- **'2'**: Control LED based on motion sensor.
- **'3'**: Control LED based on light sensor.
- **'4'**: Control LED based on both sensors.
